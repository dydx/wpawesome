# The wpawesome manifesto

If you want your thing to be included on `wpawesome`, make sure it's truly awesome. After all, it's a curation, not a collection.

But **what is awesome?**

## Only awesome is awesome

Only include stuff that's really is great. Not "typical" plugins like yet another lightbox script. Instead, include stuff that saves developers a lot of time, is really well built, and isn't useful to only a few people. If you're not sure, it doesn't hurt to ask!
